## Features

Certainly! Here's a concise README content focusing on the mentioned points (1, 2, and 4):

## Features

1. **Simple Two-Way Communication:**
   - Enables real-time communication between a master server and multiple clients.
   - Clients can send and receive messages seamlessly, fostering efficient interactions.

2. **Modular Task Execution:**
   - Register custom task functions on the server for dynamic execution.
   - Clients submit tasks, and the server executes corresponding functions, allowing for easy extensibility.

3. **Graceful Server Shutdown:**
   - Ensures a controlled termination process upon server shutdown requests.
   - Closes client connections gracefully, maintaining stability in the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eddiegulay/EchoSocket.git
   ```

   or download and extract the ZIP file.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd EchoSocket
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   # we use sockets for this project. it's a built-in module, so no need to install anything!
   ```

## Usage

- **slave.py:** Where the client script is located.

## Using EchoSocket

### Server Setup

1. **Create Server Instance:**

   In your `master.py` file, create an instance of the server and define your custom task functions.

   ```python
   # master.py
   from src.server import Server

   def reverse_string_task(data):
       return data[::-1]

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Create a server instance
       master = Server("127.0.0.1", 8080, "Master")

       # Register task functions
       master.register_task_function('reverse', reverse_string_task)
      
      # you can register as many functions as you can
      
       # Run the server
       master.run()
   ```

2. **Run the Master Server:**

   Execute the `master.py` script to start the master server.

   ```bash
   python master.py
   ```

### Client Interaction

3. **Start a Slave Client:**

   In your `slave.py` file, create an instance of the client and send a task.

   ```python
   # slave.py
   from src.client import Client

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Create a client instance
       slave = Client("127.0.0.1", 8080, "Slave")

       # Send a task to reverse a string
       slave.send_task('reverse', 'Hello, EchoSocket!')

       # Wait for the response from the server
       response = slave.client_socket.recv(1024).decode('utf-8')
       print(f"Reversed Output: {response}")

       # Close the client connection
       slave.close_client()
   ```

4. **Run the Slave Client:**

   Execute the `slave.py` script to start the slave client.

   ```bash
   python slave.py
   ```

## Examples

### Reverse Shell

EchoSocket can be used to create a simple reverse shell. In this example, we have a master server (`reverse_shell_portal.py`) and a portal client (`reverse_shell_portal.py`). The portal allows an attacker to send commands to the server and receive the output.

#### Running the Example

1. Start the master server:

   ```bash
   python master.py
   ```

2. Run the worm script to initiate the server:

   ```bash
   python reverse_shell_worm.py
   ```

3. Run the reverse shell portal to interact with the server:

   ```bash
   python reverse_shell_portal.py
   ```

   You can now enter commands in the portal, and the server will execute them, sending back the output.

#### Available Commands
the demo function does not work with commands that do not return a value. 
You can make a custom function to handle commands that do not return a value.
